# rockfish-conservation

## Purpose
Rockfish is a vulnerable fish specie that is being overfished by commercial and game fishing, with several species on the endangered or threatened list. Several agencies are invested in the conservation awareness efforts. Since rockfish live in deep water, they often experience barotrauma when they are caught. An important part of awareness is to educate the fishing community about species identification and safe catch-and-release methods to protect species that are most vulnerable.
